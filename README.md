# Employee Tracker

## Description
This app is a JavaScript program that interacts with a MySQL database to manage employee data. It uses the Inquirer package to prompt the user with a list of actions they can take, such as viewing employees, departments, and roles, adding new employees, departments, and roles, updating employee information, and deleting data. The program also uses the table package to display the data in a formatted table. The program is designed to be run in a command-line interface.

## Installation 
Users can get started with this app by running the index.js file in their terminal and following the prompts to view, add, update, or delete employees, departments, and roles in a company database. The app uses inquirer and MySQL npm packages to interact with the user and the database. The initial prompt presents a list of options for the user to choose from, and each option corresponds to a function that performs a specific task. The app also includes validation for user input to ensure that required fields are not left blank. Before using this app, users will need to have a MySQL account set up with the appropriate permissions to access and modify the database. The app assumes that the user has a MySQL server running locally on their machine, but the connection details can be modified in the connection.js file if necessary. The user will need to provide their MySQL username and password in the connection.js file to establish a connection to the database.
